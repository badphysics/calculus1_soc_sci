{\large Steps to solve Maximum and Minimum problems}

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Understand the problem:} The first step is to read the problem carefully until it is clearly understood.  What is unkown? What is given? Are there any conditions?
\item {\bf Draw a diagram: } In most problems itis useful to draw a diagram and identify the given quantities on the diagram.
\item{\bf Introduce notation: } Assign variables to the quantity, $Q$, to be maximized or minimized.  Also select symbols for other unknowns and label diagram with them.
\item{\bf Express the variable to me optimized  } in terms of other variables.
\item {\bf eliminate all but one variable} and write the domain of the function\
  \item {\bf Find absolute max or min. }
\end{enumerate}

%Copy the following block of text for each problem in the assignment.
\begin{problem}{1}
   A farmer has 2000 ft of fencing and wants to fence off a rectangular field that borders a straight river.  He needs no fence along the river.  What are the dimensions of the field that has the largest area?
   \end{problem}
     
  \problem{2} A can is to made to hold 1 L of maple syrup.  find the dimensions that will minimize the cost of the metal to make the can.

  \problem{3} Find the point on the parabola $y^2 = 2x$ that is closest to the point $(1,4)$.

  \problem{4} find the area of the largest rectangle that can be incribed in a semi circle of radius r.

  \problem{5} A company estimates that the cost of producing $x$ items is $C(x) = 2600 + 2x + 0.001x^2$.
  \begin{description}
  \item[a.] Find the cost, the average cost, and the marginal cost of producing 1000 items, 2000 items, and 3000 items.
  \item[b.] At what production level will the average cost be lowest, and what is this minimum cost?
    
  \end{description}

  \problem{6}  What production level will maximize profits for a company with cost and demand functions $\displaystyle C(x) = 3800 + 5x -\frac{x^2}{1000}$, and $\displaystyle p(x) = 50-\frac{x}{100}$

  \problem{7} A Norman window has the shape of a rectangle surmounted by a semicircle.  If the perimeter of the window is 30 ft, find the dimensions of the window so that the greatest possible amount of light is admitted.

  \problem{8} A piece of wire 10 m long is cut into two pieces.  One piece is bent into a square and the other is bent into an equilateral triangle.  How should the wire be cut so that the total area enclosed is (a) a maximum? (b) a minimum?
