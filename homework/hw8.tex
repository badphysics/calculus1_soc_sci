%Copy the following block of text for each problem in the assignment.
\begin{problem}{1}
  Plot the following graphs.  Provide the following information: domain and range, critical points, inflection points, intervals of increasing and decreasing, intervals where concave up or down, asymptotes, $x$ and $y$ intercepts, relative extrema.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $q(x)= 2x^3-15x^2+36x -20$
    \item $\displaystyle f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x-\sqrt{x}$
  \item $\displaystyle f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2 - 2}$
  \item $\displaystyle f(x) = \frac{x^2+4}{x^2-4}$
  \item $\displaystyle f(x)=\frac{9x}{(3x+1)^2}$
  \item $\displaystyle f(x)=x^3-3x+3$
  \item $\displaystyle   g(x) = x - 3x^{1/3}$
    \item $\displaystyle h(x) = \displaystyle \frac{x+1}{x^3-2x}$
