# 1.

Compute the derivatives of the following functions.

a. $f(x) = \sin(2x)$

b. $g(x) = \sin(x^2)$

c. $h(x) = x^2\cos(x^2)$

d. $f(x) = 10\tan(x)+5\sec(x)$

e. $g(t) = t^3-t^2\sin(t)$

f. $h(t) = (\sin(x^2))^2$

g. $g(x) = \displaystyle\frac{x+\tan(x)}{1+csc(x)}$

h. $f(x) = \displaystyle\frac{\sin(x)}{x}$


# 2.

Find the tangent line to $f(x) = \tan(x) + 9\cos(x)$ at $x=\pi$.


# 3.

Where in the range $[-2,7]$ is the function $f(x) = 4\cos(x) -x$ increasing and decreasing.

# 4.

An observer watches a rocket launch from a distance of 2 km. the angle of elevation $\theta$ is increasing at $3^o$ per second at the instant when $\theta = 45^o$.  How fast is the rocket climbing at that instant.


# 5.

The beacon of a lighthouse 1 km from a straight shore revolves 5 times per minute and shines a spot of light on the shore.

a. How fast is the spot of light moving when $\theta = 30^o$?

b.  What happens to the velocity of the spot light as $\theta approaches $90^o$?
